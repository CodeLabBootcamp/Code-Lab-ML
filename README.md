This repository contains the lecture notes of Code Lab's Introduction to Machine Learning course.

### Week 1

Introduction to Python basics and 3rd party libraries that are used in Machine Learning and Data Science like Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

### Week 2

Introduction to Scikit Learn, a Machine Learning library with a focus on Linear/Logistic regression algorithms.

### Week 3

More Scikit Learn, focusing on the Support Vector Machine algorithm, evaluation metrics, cross-validation, and hyperparameters tuning using Grid Search.

### Week 4

Introduction to TensorFlow and Fully Connected Neural Networks

### Week 5

Continuing with TensorFlow and focusing on computer vision using Convolutional Neural Networks and using pre-trained models with Transfer Learning.

### Week 6

More TensorFlow with a focus on sequence and text data using Recurrent Neural Networks and Long-Short-Term Memory Cells (LSTM), as well as hyperparameters tuning using KerasTuner.
